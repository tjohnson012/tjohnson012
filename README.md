- # Hola, Mundo! 👋

I'm Jalon Johnson, a student at the University of Cincinnati, double majoring in Computer Science and Spanish. 😁

## About Me
My goal is to create tech that is accessible for all. Their are many things that we love that many people don't have the ability to use due to their backgrounds, especially disablities. I want to make sure that all technology I create can be accessed by those who need it.
